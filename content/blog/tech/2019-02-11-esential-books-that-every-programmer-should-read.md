> Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places — Darren Hardy

The idea to collect a list of books that knowledgeable, experienced and well-known programmers recommends to read comes to me from [The long Journey to Ruby Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqq6_zu8x6o&feature=youtu.be) conference talk by Bozhidar Batsov.

Here I share what I have found so far: the books recommendations from the Bozhidar talk, lists by Uncle Bob, and Kent Beck, books from blog posts by Jeff Atwood and DHH.

---

**Bozhidar Batsov** VP Engineering at Toptal and open-source hacker in his talk named 15 books to reach mastery as a programmer independently of programming language:

* Inside the Machine how computers work
* CODE processors and stuff
* Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs proper introduction into programming
* How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing

Even if you have 20 years of experience in programming you can learn a lot from the books above thinks Bozhidar.


* The Algorithm Design Manual and Introduction to Algorithms for a good understanding of algorithms
* good programmers should understand how compilers works Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools
* every programmer should know C Programming Language
* Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
* Unix Network Programming volume 1 and 2

> This a essential minimum for a good developer.
>
> – Bozhidar

For programmers working with object-oriented languages Bozhidar recommends:

* Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests
* Domain-Driven Design

The last book in Bozhidar's list is The Elements of Programming Style.

I asked Robert C. Martin, aka **Uncle Bob Martin**, software engineer, [author](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-C.-Martin/e/B000APG87E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?qid=1549506215&sr=1-2-ent&linkCode=sl2&tag=sdm05-20&linkId=717262290b5f8817e7c157f421fdc1a5), [instructor](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/training), co-author of Agile Manifesto, for books recommendations. Here is his list:

* Design Patterns
