The idea to collect a list of books that knowledgeable, experienced and well-known programmers recommends to read comes to me from [The long Journey to Ruby Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqq6_zu8x6o&feature=youtu.be) conference talk by Bozhidar Batsov.

Here I share what I have found so far: the books recommendations from the Bozhidar's talk, lists by Uncle Bob, and Kent Beck, books from blog posts by Jeff Atwood and DHH.

**Bozhidar Batsov** VP Engineering at Toptal and open-source hacker in his talk named 15 books to reach mastery as a programmer independently of programming language:

* [Inside the Machine](https://amzn.to/2IJKswJ) how computers work
* [CODE](https://amzn.to/2KjIKp1) processors and stuff
* [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science](https://amzn.to/2IOSep2)
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://amzn.to/2MPVNRm) proper introduction into programming
* [How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing](https://amzn.to/31AShNR)

Even if you have 20 years of experience in programming you can learn a lot from the books above thinks Bozhidar.


* [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://amzn.to/31A9tTH) and [Introduction to Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2ILXE4k) for a good understanding of algorithms
* good programmers should understand how compilers works [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://amzn.to/2Rmt8BN)
* every programmer should know [C Programming Language](https://amzn.to/2MQddgq)
* [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://amzn.to/2KPZBPE)
* Unix Network Programming [volume 1](https://amzn.to/2WLiWUC) and [volume 2](https://amzn.to/2Rjs69V)

> This a essential minimum for a good developer.
>
> – Bozhidar

For programmers working with object-oriented languages Bozhidar recommends:

* [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://amzn.to/2IJAkE7)
* [Domain-Driven Design](https://amzn.to/2RigUKn)

The last book in Bozhidar's list is The Elements of Programming Style.
