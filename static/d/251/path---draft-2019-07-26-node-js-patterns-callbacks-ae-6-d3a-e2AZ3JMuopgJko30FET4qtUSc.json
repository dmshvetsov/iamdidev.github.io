This way we will see \"We call you back soon\" log (print) statement in our console before the file being processed.</p>\n<p>The second. Callbacks first argument is always an error or null if no error happened.</p>\n<p>The third. Callback error handling: always handle the error case. Unhandled errors in callback code will lead to situations when no error happens but the code doesn't work.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">if (err) /* handle error */;</code></pre></div>\n<p>The fourth. Callback error handling: do not throw inside the callback function. Callbacks are executed by the event loop and not in a place where you passed callback into some function. Thrown errors cannot be try/cactch -ed so you will end up with a terse stack trace from the event loop with a no way to debug the error.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">asyncFn(callback) {\n  // Do\n  if (err) callback(err);\n  // Don&#39;t\n  if (err) throw err;\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>The fifth. Never mix asynchronous and synchronous returns. TODO an example.</p>\n<p>The last. Callbacks are passed as the last argument. This is a convention. It is harder a read code with callbacks when a callback as the second argument in a function call with for example 4 arguments.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Node JS patterns, Callbacks","description":"All you want to know about Callbacks","related":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/draft/2019-07-26-node-js-patterns-callbacks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/tech/2019-02-11-essential-books-that-every-programmer-should-read/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Essential Books That Every Programmer Should Read","description":"The books recommendations from the Bozhidar's talk, lists by Uncle Bob, and Kent Beck, books from blog posts by Jeff Atwood and DHH.","date":"2019-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/draft/2019-08-09-node-js-patterns-observer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","description":null,"date":null}}}}
